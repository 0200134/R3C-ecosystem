# ⚙️ Architecture / Design Discussion

> “From safety to metal — the post-LLVM compiler lineage.”

---

## 🧱 Overview
What architectural problem are you addressing?  
Describe the context or layer (C++, Rust, ASM, or cross-interface).

---

## 🧩 Proposed Structure
- Diagram or flowchart (if applicable)  
- Component relations and interfaces  
- Potential dependency paths  

> Example: `C++ → R3C Core ↔ Rust → LTSS → ASM`

---

## 🔗 Dependencies / Related Work
List any existing R3C components or related projects involved:
-  
-  

---

## 🧠 Open Questions
- What risks or trade-offs exist?
- Any build or ABI challenges?

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome
Describe what success looks like.  
(Example: “Cross-ABI bridge implemented,” “CMake pipeline unified,” etc.)
