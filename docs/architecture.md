# ⚙️ R3C Ecosystem Architecture  
> “From safety to metal — the post-LLVM compiler lineage.”

---

## 1. Overview
The **R3C Ecosystem Architecture** defines a modular, transparent compiler pipeline  
linking C++, Rust, and ASM layers without LLVM.

Each subproject represents one layer of the toolchain,  
connected through open interfaces and ABI bridges.

## 2. Layered Model
| Layer | Component | Function | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|---------|
| 🧱 Core Compiler | [r3c](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) | C++ ↔ Rust transpiler | ✅ Active |
| 📦 Package System | [cpppm](https://github.com/0200134/cpppm) | Build & dependency manager | 🧱 Stable |
| 🌙 LTSS Channel | [R3C-nightly-ltss](https://github.com/0200134/R3C-nightly-ltss) | Rust→ASM nightly integration | 🧪 Experimental |
| 🦀 Rust-LTSS | [Rust-LTSS](https://github.com/0200134/Rust-ltss) | Long-term Rust sustain system | ⏳ Planned |
| 🪶 Ecosystem Docs | (This repo) | Documentation, roadmap, philosophy | 🧭 Hub |

## 3. Design Goals
- LLVM-free cross-language pipeline  
- Open ABI model between Rust ↔ C++  
- Assembly backend transparency  
- Scriptable cross-platform build (CMake + cpppm)  
- Self-sustaining compiler bootstrapping
