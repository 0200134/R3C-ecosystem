# 📅 R3C Ecosystem Roadmap  
> “Evolution is not a sprint — it’s a compilation.”

---

## 1. Timeline Overview
| Year | Phase | Key Focus |
|------|--------|------------|
| **2025** | Documentation & Stabilization | Core compiler maturity, docs, diagrams |
| **2026** | Integration | R3C ↔ cpppm connection & ABI experiments |
| **2027** | Nightly Expansion | R3C-nightly-LTSS experimental branch |
| **2028** | 🚀 Implementation Phase | Rust-LTSS, Embedded-LTSS start |
| **2029+** | Industrial Phase | Deployment, education, research |

## 2. Discussion Linkage
💬 Ideas gathered from:  
👉 [**R3C Idea Pool — Discussions**](https://github.com/0200134/R3C-ecosystem/discussions)

Each major discussion thread (tagged `architecture`, `ltss`, or `abi`)  
will feed into the roadmap’s milestones in quarterly revisions.

---

## 3. Long-Term Objectives
- Establish R3C as a reference for LLVM-free compiler research  
- Publish the “Industrial Rust LTS” whitepaper  
- Build sustainable open compiler toolchain network  
- Connect academic and industrial communities around the R3C design

---

## 4. Vision 2030
By 2030, R3C aims to:
- Become a self-hosting compiler lineage  
- Replace LLVM dependency in selected Rust domains  
- Create fully open, documented build pipelines for future systems

🪶 **R3C Ecosystem — compiling the next decade.**
