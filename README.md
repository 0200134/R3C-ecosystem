# 🪶 R3C Ecosystem  
> “Modern compilers must learn to breathe without LLVM.”  
> From safety to metal — the post-LLVM compiler lineage.

---

## 🧭 Overview
**R3C Ecosystem** connects the toolchains built under one philosophy:  
**C++ → Rust → ASM**, unified into an **LLVM-free, self-sustaining compiler pipeline.**

This project defines a new industrial compiler model —  
from legacy to safety, from safety to metal.  
It’s not a replacement, but an evolution of C and Rust into a transparent ecosystem.

## ⚙️ Philosophy
> “Modern compilers must learn to breathe without LLVM.”

C++ — heritage of power  
Rust — bridge of safety  
ASM — metal of truth  

R3C Ecosystem redefines *compilation* as a continuum,  
where languages cooperate instead of compete.  
It’s not about replacement — it’s about rebirth.

---

## 🧾 Goals
- Establish an independent build pipeline for C++, Rust, and ASM  
- Design an open ABI layer between Rust and C++ (LLVM-independent)  
- Support industrial LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System)  
- Serve as a research base for future LLVM-independent compilers
