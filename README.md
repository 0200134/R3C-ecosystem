## 🧱 Overview
**R3C Ecosystem** is the central hub connecting the independent toolchain projects born from the **R3C industrial compiler philosophy**.

Its structure unites **C++ → Rust → ASM**, forming a long-term, LLVM-free, self-sustaining toolchain model for research and industry.

> ⚙️ “From legacy to safety, from safety to metal.”

## 🧩 Ecosystem Structure

| Layer | Repository | Role | Status |
|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| 🧱 Core Compiler | [r3c](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) | Self-hosting C++ → Rust → ASM transpiler | 🔥 Mature |
| 📦 Package System | [cpppm](https://github.com/0200134/cpppm) | C++/Rust hybrid package manager | ⚙️ Growing |
| 🌿 Long-Term Sustain | [Rust-ltss](https://github.com/0200134/Rust-ltss) | Industrial Long-Term Sustain System (LTSS) | 🌾 Stable Growth |
| 🔩 Embedded Layer | [Rust-embedded-ltss](https://github.com/0200134/Rust-embedded-ltss) | Bare-metal & IoT Rust toolchain independence | 🌱 Early Growth |
| 🧬 Industrial Stable | [Rust-industrial-stable-edition-with-no-llvm](https://github.com/0200134/Rust-industrial-stable-edition-with-no-llvm) | LLVM-free Rust Industrial Stable Experiment | 🚧 Initial |

All repositories share one purpose:  
**inheritance over replacement, autonomy over dependency.**

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “C++ taught machines to think.  
> Rust taught them to stay safe.  
> ASM lets them act.”  

R3C is not about replacing LLVM —  
it’s about proving that modern compilers can **outgrow it.**

This ecosystem evolves naturally, with each repository serving as a cell in one industrial organism —  
maturing, sustaining, and spreading on its own.

---

## 🧬 Natural Growth Strategy
1. **Let the projects ferment — commit only when necessary.**  
2. **Keep documents unified and cross-linked.**  
3. **Observe GitHub analytics, not hype.**  
4. **Evolve slowly but irreversibly.**

> “Silence is stability. Stability builds legacy.”

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap
- **2026 Q1** – Ecosystem documentation refinement  
- **2026 Q3** – Cross-repo CI integration (Linux, macOS, Windows)  
- **2027** – LTSS public release & embedded toolchain exposure  
- **Beyond 2027** – R3C self-hosted compiler evolution
